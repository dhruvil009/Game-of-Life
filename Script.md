## Testing Infrastructure Setup
Our team used the online IDE, Editor and Compiler, REPL to set up the testing infrastructure.
We created repositories hosting the Game of Life code along with other required dependencies and some learning material.

Following is the structure of the testing environment:
README.md: This file gives an introduction to the setup, the folder structure, commands to execute the code and survey link.
Learning: This folder contains information giving the tester a basic introduction to the language syntax
GameOfLife: This folder contains the GOL code 

Links to repl environment:
Scala: https://repl.it/@SreemoyeeRay/GameOfLife
Lua: https://repl.it/@lotusneera/GameOfLifeinLua
Rust: https://repl.it/join/cuuikums-ppenmetsa


## Testing Process
1. Each tester was randomly assigned one of the three languages to debug.
2. The test subject was introduced to the Repl environment and asked to go through the README file.
3. The total time to go through the code and debug it was timed manually
4. We questioned the subject about the familarity of the language syntax and the ease to understand the code.
5. We clarified any doubts the tester had regarding the setup and code
6. After the debugging was over, we asked the tester to fill up a survey regarding their experience


## Observations made
To understand the tester's approach to debugging the new language, we:
1. Asked some of the following questions:
	a. How comfortable are you feeling with the syntax and semantics of the language?
	b. Are you trying to look at the logic of the code or the syntax?
	c. Does this language feel similar to any of the languages you are familiar with?
2. Observed the following and made notes:
	a. Total time taken by the tester to debug the code
	b. Number of bugs the tester was able to identify
	c. Number of bugs the tester was able to fix
	d. How many times the tester executed the code
	e. If the tester was comfortably changing the code or was cautious to make any changes
	f. If the tester was trying to understand every line of code sequentially or trying to zoom in on the bugs by analyzing the output
