## Technologies Used
1. Google forms to collect the data
2. Zoom video for observation and interactions
3. Excel Sheet to note down the observations
4. Repl.it to execute the code

## Data Collection
#### Google forms
1. Number of Bugs Found
2. Number of Bugs Fixed
3. Difficulty in understanding the language (1-5)
4. Inclination to learn particular langugae in future (1-5)

#### Observations
1. Time taken to debug
2. Familiarity with langugae (1-5)

## Conclusion
Looking at the data we have collected, we came to conclude that "Lua" is the easiest language to debug and people were more familair with the logic/language after debugging it. Also, people were more inclined to learn "Lua" compared to other langugae.
