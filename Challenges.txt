#ToDO: Include challenges for specific languages and their unique features here

Scala:
* Compilation speed is slow
* Documentation of the language is limited. Also, limited online communities presence.
* A working knowledge of java is required to be able to quickly grasp Scala.

Rust:
* There are not so many resources or questions answered for this language.
* Debug tools are not easily available.
* Since it's a primitive language, have to assign all the data types and explicitly  data conversion is needed.
